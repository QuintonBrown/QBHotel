            <p>Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay
                are the staff. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice. We
                travelled with two six year olds and lots of luggage and despite the stairs up to the elevator this was
                one of the nicest places we stayed in the four weeks we were in Europe.</p>

            <p>It was a good stay! The food was excellent and the staff superb! There was a staff member who was
                particularly helpful, accommodating and shared his knowledge about Prague with us. Unfortunately I did
                not get his name but it appeared he assisted the front desk and also carried our luggage to our room.
